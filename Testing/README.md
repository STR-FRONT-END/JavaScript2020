# Testing
* test behavior not implementation
#### Kinds of test
* Static tests catch typos and errors as you write your code. If you have any type of debugging software in your IDE, it is running static tests.
* Manual test - manually clicking around to test things out
* Unit Test - Testing individual component or unit
* Intergration Test - Testing how a group of components work together
* End to End test - Testing as a user would through automation

**All testing, of all kinds uses the framework “arrange, act, assert” where a test is written to do the following.**

* Arrange - Set up a webpage, form input, etc.
* Act - Simulate a user action, like a button click or form input.
* Assert - Verify that the simulated user action resulted in the expected output.
